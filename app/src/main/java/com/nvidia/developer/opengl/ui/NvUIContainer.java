/**
 * An object that holds and manages a group of UI elements and interactions with
 * them.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This class implements a 'container' or 'holder' object, that has no
 * particular visual of its own, rather 'proxying' its visual to the children
 * held within it. It does do custom handling for having a specific 'background'
 * visual attached to it (such as a graphic or a frame) to draw beneath the
 * children.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The main interface is the @p Add method, which allows you to generally add
 * any kind of UI element into the container, at a specific position in space.
 * The container, if moved, will properly adjust the position of all contained
 * child UI elements to keep proper relative positioning between them. This
 * allows for a container to be 'shifted' around (jumped, or slowly slid, for
 * buttonbars or or 'submenus' or the like), as well as alpha-faded (as alpha in
 * the drawstate is passed through to child @p Draw calls), and hidden/shown
 * (visibility control).
 * <p>
 * 
 * The container also has quite detailed handling of NvGestureEvents and
 * NvUIReactions, actually implementing the main 'translation' between the two
 * systems (that is, NvGestureEvents come in that a child might handle and issue
 * an NvUIReaction to, and the container code passes the reaction up. The
 * NvUIWindow class is a specialized container that automatically calls down
 * into its children after event handling to allow them a chance at processing
 * any Reaction, without further explicit code by the developer.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The container also specially manages the focus state, special-case handling
 * any incoming events, and passing them to the last-focused child for a 'first
 * shot' at those events before passing them to all children in general.
 *
